backend for one line a day journal

#project mvp

Pitch: This is the app version of the 10 year one line a day journal. Your daily entries for each day over 10 years are recorded, and you are reminded each day to record a short and sweet fact from your day- a funny quote, crazy milestone, or what you ate for dinner. 

MVP: Users can log in and start making entries in their 10 year journal. They can create, review, update, and delete data. The app functions as a journal and you can see all entries each day across 10 years at the same time. 

Stretch: Add the ability for user to upload an optional picture for the day
Stretch: Present a randome question if the user can't think of what to write
